        <b>8. CONFIDENTIALITY</b>
        <p>
          {' '}
          8.1. Definition of Confidential Information. "Confidential Information" means all information disclosed by a
          party ("Disclosing Party") to the other party ("Receiving Party"), whether orally or in writing, that is
          designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the
          information and the circumstances of disclosure. Your Confidential Information includes Your Business Data in
          explicit form. Your Business Data in anonymous form is not classified as confidential and can be used
          according to 4.6 ; Our Confidential Information includes the Service and Content; and Confidential Information
          of each party includes the terms and conditions of this Agreement and all Order Forms (including pricing), as
          well as business and marketing plans, technology and technical information, product plans and designs, and
          business processes disclosed by such party. However, Confidential Information does not include any information
          that (i) is or becomes generally known to the public without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing
          Party, (ii) was known to the Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of
          any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (iii) is received from a third party without breach of any
          obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, or (iv) was independently developed by the Receiving Party. (v) Your
          Data or Your Business Data in anonymised form.

          {' '}
          8.2. Protection of Confidential Information. The Receiving Party will use the same degree of care that it uses
          to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential information of like kind (but not less than reasonable
          care) (i) not to use any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose outside the scope of
          this Agreement, and (ii) except as otherwise authorised by the Disclosing Party in writing, to limit access to
          Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to those of its and its Affiliates' employees and contractors
          who need that access for purposes consistent with this Agreement and who have signed confidentiality
          agreements with the Receiving Party containing protections no less stringent than those herein. Neither party
          will disclose the terms of this Agreement or any Order Form to any third party other than its Affiliates,
          legal counsel and accountants without the other party's prior written consent, provided that a party that
          makes any such disclosure to its Affiliate, legal counsel or accountants will remain responsible for such
          Affiliate's, legal counsel's or accountant's compliance with this Section 8.2.
        </p>
        <p>
          {' '}
          8.3. Compelled Disclosure. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party
          to the extent compelled by law to do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice
          of the compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing
          Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled by
          law to disclose the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the
          Disclosing Party is a party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party
          will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that
          Confidential Information.
